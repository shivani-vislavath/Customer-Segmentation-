# 📊 Prodigy Task: Customer Demographics & Behavioral Insights

This project was created as part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Data science Internship**. It explores customer demographics and behavioral patterns through powerful data visualization using **Power BI**.

---

## 📍 Project Objective

This project addresses the task of creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. Specifically, it uses Power BI to analyze a population dataset and highlight patterns such as:

Distribution of gender (categorical)

Distribution of age and income (continuous)

Segment-level insights using interactive filters (slicers)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI Desktop**
* Sample customer demographic dataset (CSV)

## 📘 DAX Calculations Used

### 🎂 AgeGroup Binning:

```DAX
AgeGroup = 
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    Customers[Age] <= 25, "18–25",
    Customers[Age] <= 35, "26–35",
    Customers[Age] <= 45, "36–45",
    Customers[Age] <= 55, "46–55",
    "56+"
)
```

### 💵 IncomeGroup Binning:

```DAX
IncomeGroup = 
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    Customers[Annual Income (k$)] <= 40, "0–40",
    Customers[Annual Income (k$)] <= 70, "41–70",
    Customers[Annual Income (k$)] <= 100, "71–100",
    "101+"
)
```
